## 🚀 Overview

**Truelancer** is a comprehensive financial management platform engineered for freelancers and small businesses who need more than just a spreadsheet. It unifies professional invoicing, automated income tracking, and AI-driven expense analysis into a single, secure cloud-based solution.

Unlike simple expense trackers, Truelancer is built to be an intelligent financial assistant. It automates mundane tasks—like calculating GST on invoices or categorizing daily expenses—allowing you to focus on growing your business. The platform leverages advanced algorithms to provide actionable insights, helping you visualize cash flow trends and adhere to monthly budgets with precision.

Built on the robust **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), Truelancer offers enterprise-grade security with JWT authentication, responsive design for all devices, and scalable architecture ready for real-world deployment.
